# Audivarium-Remake

This is a remake of a game I made that basically nobody has played since it was a small project.

Audivarium is a rhythm bullet hell game where you fight back against the level.
- Dash and teleport about the field to avoid obstacles and dangers that attack in sync with the music
- A variety of weapons to fight back against the level by shooting and destroying enemies and obstacles
- Customizable player and crosshair, change your looks and colors
- A level editor using Godot 3.5

Currently there is only keyboard and mouse support, but there may be mobile support in the future

### Playing the game
Download the executable and run

### Creating levels / Modding the game
- Download this repository and open in Godot 3.5 (This was developed on 3.5.1)
- Copy EngineEditor/EngineLevelEditor.tscn into a new folder in EngineEditor/Customs
- Rename it however you like, this scene can be used to create a new custom level
- More instructions and tips are located in the scene
